# 3 Vectors

# 3.1 Introduction

# This chapter discusses the most important family of data types in base R: vectors.
# While you've probably already used many(if not all) of the different types of vectors, you may not have thought deeply about how they're interrelated.
# In this chapter, I won't cover individual vector types in too much detail, but I will show you how all the types fit together as a whole.
# If you need more details, you cna find them in R's documentation.

# Vectors come in two flavours: atomic vectors and lists. 
# They differ in terms of their elements' types: for atomic vectors, all elements must have the same type; for lists, elements can have different types.
# While not a vector, `NULL` is closely related to vectors and often servers the role of a generic zero length vector.
# This diagram, which we'll be expanding on throughout this chapter, illustrates the basic relationships:

# Every vector can also have __attributes__, which you cna think of as a named list of arbitrary metadata.
# Two attributes are particularly important. The __dimension__attribute turns vectors into matrices and arrarys and the __class__ attribute powers the S3 object system.
# While you'll learn how to use S3 in Chapter 13, here you'll learn about some of the most important S3 vectors: factors, date and times, data frames, and tibbles.
# And while 2D structures like matrices and data frames are not necessasrily what come to mind when you think of vectors, you'll also learn why R considers them to be vectors.

# Quiz

# Take this short quiz to detemin if you need to read this chapter.
# If the answers quickly come to mind, you cna comfortably skip this chapter.
# You can check your answers in Section 3.8.

# 1. What are the four common types of atomic vectors? What are the two rare types?

# 2. What are attributes? How do you get them and set them?

# 3. How is a list different from an atomic vector? How is a matrix different from a data frame?

# 4. Can you have a list that is a matrix? Can a data frame have a column that is a matrix? 

# 5. How do tibbles behave differently from data frames?

# Outline

# 3.2 Atomic vectors 

# There are four primary types of atomic vectors: logical, integer, double , and cahracter (which contains strings).
# Collectively integer and double vectors are known as numeric vectors.
# There are two rare types: complex and raw. I won't discuss them further because complex numbers are rarely needed in statistics, and raw vectors are a special type that' sonely needed when handling binary data.

# 3.2.1 Scalars

# Each of the four primary types has a special syntax to create an individual value, AKA a __scalar__:

# - Logicals can be written in full (TRUE or FALSE), or abbreviated (R or F).

# - Doubles can be specified in decimol (0.1234), scientific (1.23e4), or hexadecimal(0xcafe) form.
#   There are three special values unique to doubles: `Inf`, `-Inf`, and `NaN`(not a number).
#   These are special values defined by the floating point standard.

# - Integers are written similarly to doubles but must be followed by `L` (1234L, 1e4L, or 0xcafeL), and can not contain fractional values.

# - Strings are surrounded by `"` ("hi") or `'` ('bye'). Special characters are excaped with `\`; see `?Quotes` for full details.

# 3.2.2 Making longer vectors with `c()`

# to create longer vectors from shorter ones, use `c()`, short for combine:
lgl_var <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
int_var <- c(1L, 6L, 10L)
dbl_var <- c(1, 2.5, 4.5)
chr_var <- c("these are", "some strings")

# When the inputs are atomic vectors, `c()` always creates another atomic vector; i.e. it flattens:
c(c(1, 2), c(3, 4))
#> [1] 1 2 3 4

# In diagrams, I'll depict vectors as connected rectangles, so the above doce could be drawn as follows:

# You can detemine the type of a vector with `typeof()` and its length with `length()`.
typeof(lgl_var)
#> [1] "logical"
typeof(int_var)
#> [1] "integer"
typeof(dbl_var)
#> [1] "double"
typeof(chr_var)
#> [1] "character"

# Missing values

# R represents missing, or unknown values, with special sentinel value: `NA` (short for not applicable).
# Missing values tend to be infectious: most computations involving a missing value will return another missing value.
NA > 5
#> [1] NA
10 * NA
#> [1] NA
!NA
#> [1] NA

# There are only few exceptions to this rule. These occur when soe identity holds for all possible inputs:
NA ^ 0
#> [1] 1
NA | TRUE
#> [1] TRUE
NA & FALSE
#> [1] FALSE

# Propagation of missingness leads to a common midtake when determining which values in a vector are missing:
x <- c(NA, 5, NA, 10)
x == NA
#> [1] NA NA NA NA

# The result is correct (if a little surprising) because there's no reason to believe that one missing value has the same value as another.
# Instead, use `is.na()` to test for the presence of missingness:
is.na(x)
#> [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

# NB: Technically there are four missing values, one fo reach of the atomic types: `NA` (logical), `NA_integer_`(integer), `NA_real_`(double), and `NA_character_`(characger).
# This distinction is usually unimportant because `NA` will be automatically coerced to the correct type when needed.

# 3.2.4 Testing and coercion

# Generally, you can _test_ if a vector is of a given type with an `is.*()` function, but these functions need to be used with care.
# `is.logical()`, `is.integer()`, `is.double()`, and `is.character()` do what you might expect: they test if a vector is a character, double, integer, or logical.
# Avoid `is.vector()` `is.atomic()`, and `is.numeric()`: they don't test if you have a vector, atomic vector, or numeric vector;
# you 'll need to carefully read the documentation to figure out what they actually do.

# For atomic vectors, type is a property of the entire vector: all elements must be the same type. 
# When you attempt to combine different types they will be _coerced_ in a fixed order: haracter -> double -> integer -> logical.
# For example, combining a character and integer yields a character:
str(c("a", 1))
#> chr [1:2] "a" "1"

# Coercion ofter happens automatically. Most mathematical functions(`+`, `log`, `abs`, etc.) will coerce to numeric.
# This coercion is particularly useful for logical vactors because `TURE` becomes 1 and `FALSE` becomes 0.
x <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
as.numeric(x)
#> [1] 0 0 1

# Total number of TRUEs
sum(x)
#> [1] 1

# Proportion that are TRUE
mean(x)
#> [1] 0.3333333

# Genrerally, you can deliberately coerce by using an `as.*()` function, like `as.logical()`, `as.integer()`, `as.double()`, or `as.character()`.
# Failed coercion of strings generates a warning and a missing value:
as.integer(c("1", "1.5", "a"))
#> [1]  1  1 NA
#> Warning message: NAs introduced by coercion

# 3.2.5 Exercises

# 1. How do you create raw and coplex scalars? (See `?raw` and `?complex`.)

# In R scalars are represented as vectors of length one.
# For raw and complex types these can be created via `raw()` and `complex()`, i.e.:
raw(1)
#> [1] 00
complex(1)
#> [1] 0+0i

# Raw vectors can easily be created from numeric or character values.
as.raw(42)
#> [1] 2a
charToRaw("A")
#> [1] 41

# For complex numbers real and imaginary parts may be provided directly.
complex(length.out = 1, real = 1, imaginary = 1)
#> [1] 1+1i

# 2. test your knowledge of the vector coercion rules by predicting the output of the following uses of `c()`:
c(1, FALSE)   # will be coerced to numeric:    [1] 1 0 
c("a", 1)     # will be coerced to character:  [1] "a" "1"
c(TRUE, 1L)   # will be coerced to integer:    [1] 1 1

# 3. Why is `1 == "1"` true? Why is -1 < FALSE true? Why is "one" < 2 false?

# These comparisions are carried out by operator-functions, which coerce their arguments to a common type.
# In the examples above these cases will be character, double and character: `1` ill be coerced to `"1"`, `FALSE` is represented as `0` and `2` turns into `"2"` (and numerals preced letters in the lexicographic order(may depend on locale)).

# 4. Why is the default missing value, NA, a logical vector? 
#    Whatâ€™s special about logical vectors? (Hint: think about c(FALSE, NA_character_).)

# The presence of missing values shouldn't affect the type of an object.
# Reclal that there is type-hierarchy for coecion from character >> double >> integer >> logical.
# Whtn combing `NA`s with other atomic types, the `NA`s will be coerced to integer(NA_integer_) , double(NA_real_) ro character(NA_character_) and not the other way round.
# If `NA` was a character and added to a set of other values all of these would be coerced to character as will.

# 5. Precisely what do is.atomic(), is.numeric(), and is.vector() test for?

# The codumentation states that:

# - `is.atomic()` tests if is an atomic vector(as defined in Advanced R) or is `NULL`.
# - `is.numeric()` tests if an object has type integer or double and is not of `"factor"`, `"Date"`, `"POSIXt"` or `"difftime"` class.
# - `is.vector()` tests if an object is vector is vector(as defined in Advanced R) and has no attributes, apart from names.

# 3.3 Attributes 

# You might have noticed that the set of atomic vectors does not include a number of important data structures like matrices, arrarys, factors, or date-times.
# These types are built on top of atomic vectors by adding attribues. In this section, you'll learn the basics of attributes, and how the dim attributes.
# In this section, you'll learn the basics of attributes, and how the dim attribute makes matrices and arrarys.
# In the next section you'll learn how the class attributes is used to create S3 vectors, including factors, dates, and date-times.

# 3.3.1 Getting and setting 

# You can think of attributes as name-value pairs that attach metadata to an object.
# Individual attributes can be retrieved and modified with `attr()`, or retrieved en masse with `attributes()`, and set en masse with `structure()`.
a <- 1:3
attr(a, "x") <- "abcdef"
attr(a, "x")
#> [1] "abcdef"

attr(a, "y") <- 4:6
str(attributes(a))
#> List of 2
#> $ x: chr "abcdef"
#> $ y: int [1:3] 4 5 6

# Or equivalently
a <- structure(
  1:3, 
  x = "abcdef",
  y = 4:6
)
str(attributes(a))

# Attributes should generally be thought of as ephemeral. For exmaple, most attribues are lost by most operations:
attributes(a[1])
#> NULL
attributes(sum(a))
#> NULL

# There are only two attributes that are routinely preserved:

# - __names__, a character vector giving each element a name:
# - __dim__, short for dimensions, an integer vector, used to turn vectors into matrices or arrarys.

# To preserve other attributes, you'll need to create your own S3 class, the topic of Chapter 13.

# 3.2.2 Naemes

# You can name a vector in three ways:

# When creating it:
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)

# By assigning a character vector to names()
x <- 1:3
names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Inline, with setNames():
x <- setNames(1:3, c("a", "b", "c"))

# Avoid using `attr(x, "names")` as it requires more typing and is less reable than `names(x)`.
# You can remove names from a vector by using `unname(x)` or `names(x) <- NULL`.

# To be technically correct, when drawing the names vector `x`, I should draw it like so:

# However, names are so special and so important, that unless I'm trying specifically ot draw attention to the attributes data structrue, 
# I'll use them to label the vector directly:

# |---|----|----|
# | 1 | 2  | 3  |
# |---|----|----|
#   a   b    c 

# To by useful with character subsetting (e.g Section 4.5.1) names should be unique, and non-missing, but this is not enforced by R.
# Depending on how the names are set, missing names may be either `""` or `NA_character_`.
# If all names are missing, `names()` will return `NULL`.

# 3.3.3 Dimensions 

# Adding a `dim` attribute to a vector allows ti to behave like a 2-dimenional __matrix__ or a multi-dimensional __array__.
# Matrices and arrarys are primarily mathematical and statistical tools, not programming tools, so they'll be used infrequently and only covered briefly in this book.
# Their most important feature is multidimensional subsetting, which is covered in Section 4.2.3.

# You can create matrices and arrays with `matrix()` and `array()`, or by using the assignment form of `dim()`:

# Tow scalar arguments specify row and column sizes 
a <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
# a
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    1    3    5
#> [2,]    2    4    6

# One vector argument ot describe all dimensions 
b <- array(1:12, c(2, 3, 2))
b
#> , , 1
#> 
#>       [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    1    3    5
#> [2,]    2    4    6
#> 
#> , , 2
#> 
#>       [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    7    9   11
#> [2,]    8   10   12

# You can also modify an object in place by setting dim()
c <- 1:6
dim(c) <- c(3, 2)
c
#>       [,1] [,2]
#> [1,]    1    4
#> [2,]    2    5
#> [3,]    3    6

# Many of the functions for working with vectors have heneralisations for matriced and arrays:

# |-----------------|------------------------|----------------|
# | Vector          | Matrix                 | Array          |
# |-----------------|------------------------|----------------|
# | names()         | rownames(), colnames() | dimnames()     |
# |                 |                        |                |
# | length()        | nrow(), ncol()         | dim()          |
# |                 |                        |                |
# | c()             | rbind(), cbind()       | abind::abind() |
# |                 |                        |                |
# | -               | t()                    | aperm()        |
# |                 |                        |                |
# | is.null(dim(x)) | is.matrix()            | is.array()     |
# |-----------------|------------------------|----------------|

# A vector without a `dim` attribute set is often thought of as 1-dimensional, but actually has `NULL` dimensions.
# You also can have matrices with a single row or single column, or arrays with a single dimension.
# They may print similarly, but iwll behave differently .
# The differences aren't too important, but it's useful to know they exist incase you get strange output from a function (`tapply()`) is a frequent offender).
# As always, use `str()` to reveal the differences.
str(1:3)                    # 1d vector
#> int [1:3] 1 2 3
str(matrix(1:3, ncol = 1))  # column vector
#> int [1:3, 1] 1 2 3
str(matrix(1:3, nrow = 1))  # row vector 
#> int [1, 1:3] 1 2 3
str(array(1:3, 3))          # "array" vector 
#> int [1:3(1d)] 1 2 3

# 3.3.4 Exercises 

# 1. How is `setNames()` implemented? How is `unnames()` implemented? Read the souce code.
setNames

# setNames() is imoplemented as: 
setNames <- function (object = nm, nm) {
  names(object) <- nm
  object
}

# Because the data argument comes first `setNames()` also works well with the magrittr-pipe operator.
# When no first argument is given, the result is a named vector:
setNames( , c("a", "b", "c"))

# `unname()` is implemented in the following way:
unname <- function(obj, force = TRUE) {
  if (!is.null(names(obj)))
    names(obj) <- NULL
  if (!is.null(dimnames(obj)) && (force || !is.data.frame(obj)))
    dimnames(obj) <- NULL
  obj
}
# `unname()` removes existing names(or dimnames) by setting them to `NULL`.

# 2. What does `dim()` return when applied to a 1-dimensional vector? When might you use `NROW()` or `NCOL()`?

# From `?nrow`
# # dim() will return `NULL` when applied to a 1d vector.

# One may want to use `NROW()` or `NCOL()` ot handle atomic vectors, lists and NULL vlaues in the same way a sone column matrices or data frames.
# For these objects `nrow()` and `ncol()` return  `NULL`.
x <- 1:10
# return NULL
nrow(x)
#> NULL
ncol(x)
#> NULL

# Pretend it's a column-vector
NROW(x)
#> [1] 10
NCOL(x)
#> [1] 1

# 3. How would you describe the following three objects?
#    What makes them different from `1:5` ?
x1 <- array(1:5, c(1, 1, 5))
x2 <- array(1:5, c(1, 5, 1))
x3 <- array(1:5, c(5, 1, 1))

# These are all "one dimensional".
# If you imagine a 3d cube, `x1` is in "x" dimenision, `x2` is in the "y" dimension, and `x3` is in the "z" dimension.

# 4. An early draft used this code to illustrate `structure()`:
structure(1:5, comment = "my attribute")
#> [1] 1 2 3 4 5
#    But when you print that object you don't see the comment attribute. Why?
#    Is the attribute missing, or is there something slses special about it? (Hint: try using help.)

# The documentation states (see ?comment):
# Contrary to other attributes, the comment is not printed (by print fo print.default).

# Also, from ?attributes:
# Note that some attributes (namely class, comment, dim, dimnames, names, row.names and tsp) are treated specially and have restricions on the values which can be set.

# We can retrieve comment attributes by calling them explicitly:
foo <- structure(1:5, comment = "my attribute")

attributes(foo)
#> $comment
#> [1] "my attribute"
attr(foo, which = "comment")
#> [1] "my attribute"

# 3.4 S3 atomic vectors

# One of the most important vector attributes is `class`, which underlies the S3 object system.
# Having a class attribute turns an object into an __S3 object__, which means it will behave different from a regular vector when passed to a __generic__ function.
# Every S3 object is built on top of a base type, and often stores additional information in other attributes.
# You'll learn the details of the S3 object system, and how to create your own S3 classes, in Chapter 13.

# In this section, we'll discuss four important S3 vectors used in base R:

# - Categorical data, where values come from a fixed set of levels recorded in __factor__ vectors.
# - Dates (with day resolution), which are recoreded in __Date__ vectors.
# - Date-times (with second or sub-second resolution), which are stored in __POSIXct__ vectors.
# - Durations, which are stored in _difftime__ vectors.

# 3.4.1 Factors

# A factor is a vector that can contain only predefined values. It is used to store categorical data.
# Factors are built on top of an integer vector with two attributes: a `class`, "factor", which makes it behave differently from regular integer vectors, 
# and `levels`, which defines the set of allowed values.
x <- factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"))
x
#> [1] a b b a
#> Levels: a b

typeof(x)
#> [1] "integer"
attributes(x)
#> $levels
#> [1] "a" "b"
#> 
#> $class
#> [1] "factor"

# Factors are useful when you know the set of possible vaules but they're not all present in a given dataset.
# In contrast to a character vector, when you tabulate a factor you'll get counts of all categories, even unobserved ones:
sex_char <- c("m", "m", "m")
sex_factor <- factor(sex_char, levels = c("m", "f"))
table(sex_char)
#> sex_char
#> m 
#> 3
table(sex_factor)
#> sex_factor
#> m f 
#> 3 0

# __Ordered__ factors are a minor variation of factors. In general, they behave like regular factors, 
# but the order fo the levels is meaningful (low, medium, high) (a property that is automatically leveraged by some modelling and visualisation functions.)
grade <- ordered(c("b", "b", "a", "c"), levels = c("c", "b", "a"))
grade
#> [1] b b a c
#> Levels: c < b < a

# In base R you tend to encounter factors frequently because many base R functions (like `read.csv()` and `data.frame()`) automaticlaly convert character vectors to factors.
# This is suboptimal because there's no way for those functions to know the set of all possible levels or their correct order: the levels are a property of theory or experimental design, not of the data.
# Instead, use the argument `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` to supress this behaviour, and then manually convert character vecotrs to factors using your knowledge of the "theoretical" data.
# to learn about the historical context of this behaviour, I recommend `stringsAsFactors: An unauthorized biography` by Roger Peng, and stringsAsFactors = <sign> by Thomas Lumley.

# While factors look like (and often behave like) character vectors, they are built on top of integers. 
# So be careful when treating them like strings. 
# Some string methods (like gsub() and grepl()) will automatically coerce factors to strings, others (like nchar()) will throw an error, 
# and still others will (like c()) use the underlying integer values. 
# For this reason, itâ€™s usually best to explicitly convert factors to character vectors if you need string-like behaviour.

# 3.4.2 Dates

# Date vectors are built on top of double vectors. They have class "Date" and no other attributes:
today <- Sys.Date()

typeof(today)
#> [1] "double"
attributes(today)
#> $class
#> [1] "Date"

# The value of the double (which can be seen by stripping the class), represents the number of days since 1970-01-01:
date <- as.Date("1970-02-01")
unclass(date)
#> [1] 31

# 3.4.3 Date-times

# Base R provides two ways of storing date-time information, POSIXct, and POSIXlt.
# These are admittedly odd names: "POSIX" is short for Portable Operating System Interface, which is a family of cross-platform standards.
# "ct" stardards for calendar time (the `time_t` type in C), and "lt" for local time (the `struct tm` type in C).
# Here we'll focus on `POSIXct`, because it's the simplest, is built on top of an atomic vector, and is most appropriate for use in data frames.
# POSIXct vectors are built on top of double vectors, where the value represents the number of seconds since 1970-01-01.
now_ct <- as.POSIXct("2018-08-01 22:00", tz = "UTC")
now_ct
#> [1] "2018-08-01 22:00:00 UTC"

typeof(now_ct)
#> [1] "double"
attributes(now_ct)
#> $class
#> [1] "POSIXct" "POSIXt" 
#> 
#> $tzone
#> [1] "UTC"

# The `tzone` attribute controls only how the date-time is formatted; it does not control the instant of time represented by the vector. 
# Note that the time is not printed if it is midnight.

structure(now_ct, tzone = "Asia/Tokyo")
#> [1] "2018-08-02 07:00:00 JST"
structure(now_ct, tzone = "America/New_York")
#> [1] "2018-08-01 18:00:00 EDT"
structure(now_ct, tzone = "Australia/Lord_Howe")
#> [1] "2018-08-02 08:30:00 +1030"
structure(now_ct, tzone = "Europe/Paris")
#> [1] "2018-08-02 CEST"

# 3.4.4 Durations

# Durations, which represent the amount of time between parirs of dates or date-times, are stored in difftimes.
# Difftimes are built on top of doubles, and have a `units` attribute that determines how the integer should be interpreted:
one_week_1 <- as.difftime(1, units = "weeks")
one_week_1
#> Time difference of 1 weeks

typeof(one_week_1)
#> [1] "double"
attributes(one_week_1)
#> $class
#> [1] "difftime"
#> 
#> $units
#> [1] "weeks"

one_week_2 <- as.difftime(7, units = "days")
one_week_2
#> Time difference of 7 days

typeof(one_week_2)
#> [1] "double"
attributes(one_week_2)
#> $class
#> [1] "difftime"
#> 
#> $units
#> [1] "days"

# 3.4.5 Exercises 

# 1. What sort of object does `table()` return? What is its type? What attributs does it have?
#    How does the dimensionality change as you tabulate more variables?

# `table()` returns a contigency table of its input variables, which has the class `"table"`.
# Internally it is represented as an array (implicit class) of integers (type) with the attributes `dim` (dimension of the underlying array) and `dimnames` (one name for each input column).
# The dmensions correspond to the number of unique values (factor levels) in each input variable.
x <- table(mtcars[c("vs", "cyl", "am")])
typeof(x)
#> [1] "integer"
attributes(x)
#> $dim
#> [1] 2 3 2
#> 
#> $dimnames
#> $dimnames$vs
#> [1] "0" "1"
#> 
#> $dimnames$cyl
#> [1] "4" "6" "8"
#> 
#> $dimnames$am
#> [1] "0" "1"
#> 
#> 
#> $class
#> [1] "table"



# 2. What happens to a factor when you modify its levels?
f1 <- factor(letters)
levels(f1) <- rev(levels(f1))

# The underlying integer values stay the same, but the levels are changed, making it look like the data as changed.
f1 <- factor(letters[1:10])
levels(f1)
#> [1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h" "i" "j"
f1
#> [1] a b c d e f g h i j
#> Levels: a b c d e f g h i j
as.integer(f1)
#> [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

levels(f1) <- rev(levels(f1))
levels(f1)
#> [1] "j" "i" "h" "g" "f" "e" "d" "c" "b" "a"
f1
#>  [1] j i h g f e d c b a
#> Levels: j i h g f e d c b a
as.integer(f1)
#> [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10

# 3. What does this code do? How do `f2` and `f3` differ from `f1`?
f2 <- rev(factor(letters))
f3 <- factor(letters, levels = rev(letters))

# For `f2` and `f3` either the order of the factor elements or its levels are being reversed.
# For `f1` both trasformations are occuring.

# 3.5 Lists

# Lists are a step up in complexity from atomic vectors: each element can be any type, not just vectors.
# Technically speaking, each element of a list is actually the same type. because, as you saw in Section 2.3.3, each element is really reference to another object, which can be any type.

# 3.5.1 Creating 

# You construct lists with `list()`:
l1 <- list(
  1:3,
  "a",
  c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE),
  c(2.3, 5.9)
)

typeof(l1)
#> [1] "list"

str(l1)
#> List of 4
#>  $ : int [1:3] 1 2 3
#>  $ : chr "a"
#>  $ : logi [1:3] TRUE FALSE TRUE
#>  $ : num [1:2] 2.3 5.9

# Because the elements of a list are references, creating a list does not involve cipying the components inot the list.
# For this reasion, the total size of a list might be smaller than you might expect.
lobstr::obj_size(mtcars)
#> 7,208 B

l2 <- list(mtcars, mtcars, mtcars, mtcars)
lobstr::obj_size(l2)
#> 7,288 B

# Lists can contain complex objects so it's not possible to pick a single visual style that works for every list.
# Generally I'll draw lists like vectors, using colour to remind you of the hierarchy.

# Lists are somtimes called recursive vectors because a list can contain other lists.
# This makes them fundamentally different from atomic vectors.
l3 <- list(list(list(1)))
str(l3)
#> List of 1
#>  $ :List of 1
#>   ..$ :List of 1
#>   .. ..$ : num 1

# `c()` will combine several lists into one. If given a combination of vectors and lists, `c()` will coerce the vectors to lists before combining them.
# Compare the results of `lsit()` and `c()`:
l4 <- list(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))
l5 <- c(list(1, 2), c(3, 4))
str(l4)
#> List of 2
#>  $ :List of 2
#>   ..$ : num 1
#>   ..$ : num 2
#>  $ : num [1:2] 3 4
str(l5)
#> List of 4
#>  $ : num 1
#>  $ : num 2
#>  $ : num 3
#>  $ : num 4

# 3.5.2 Testing and coercion

# The `typeos()` a list is `list`. You can test for a list with `is.list()`, and coerce to a list with `as.list()`.
list(1:3)
#> [[1]]
#> [1] 1 2 3
as.list(1:3)
#> [[1]]
#> [1] 1
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> [1] 2
#> 
#> [[3]]
#> [1] 3

# You can turn a list into an atomic vector with `unlist()`. 
# The rules for the resulting type are complex, not well documented, and not always equivalent to what you'd get with `c()`.

# 3.5.3 Matrices and arrays

# With atomic vectors, the dimension attribute is commonly used to create matrices.
# With lists, the dimension attribute can be used to create list-matrices or list-arrays:

l <- list(1:3, "a", TRUE, 1.0)
dim(l) <- c(2, 2)
l
#>      [,1]      [,2]
#> [1,] Integer,3 TRUE
#> [2,] "a"       1
l[[1, 1]]
#> [1] 1 2 3

# These data structures are relatively esoteric but they can be useful if you want to arrange objects in a grid-like structure.
# For example, if you're running omdels on a spatio-temporal grid, it might be more intuitive to store the models in a 3D array that matches the grid structure.

# 3.5.4 Exercises

# 1. List all the ways tha ta list differs from a atomic vector.

# To summarise:

# - Atomic vectors are always homogeneous (all elements must be of the same type).
#   Lists may be heterogeneous (the elements can be of different types).

# - Atomic vactors point to one address in memory, while lists contain a separate references for each element.
lobstr::ref(1:2)
#> [1:0x10fbe3bc0] <int> 
lobstr::ref(list(1:2, 2))
#> â–ˆ [1:0x10fba3348] <list> 
#> â”œâ”€[2:0x10b6a2e78] <int> 
#> â””â”€[3:0x10f79da58] <dbl>

# - Subsetting with out of bound values or `NA`s leads to `NA`s for atomics and `NULL` values for lists.

# Subsetting atomic vectors
(1:2)[3]
#> [1] NA
(1:2)[NA]
#> [1] NA NA

# Subsetting lists
as.list(1:2)[3]
#> [[1]]
#> NULL
as.list(1:2)[NA]
#> [[1]]
#> NULL
#> 
#> [[2]]
#> NULL

# 2. Why do you need to use `unlist()` to convert a list to an atomic vector?
#    Why doesn't `as.vector()` work?

# A list is already a vector, though not an atomic one!
# Note that `as.vector()` and `is.vector()` use different definitions of "vector"!
is.vector(as.vector(mtcars))
#> [1] FALSE

# 3. Compare and contrast `c()` and `unlist()` when combining a date and date-time into a single vector.

date <- as.Date("1970-01-02")
dttm_ct <- as.POSIXct("1970-01-01 01:00", tz = "UTC")

c(date, dttm_ct)  # equal to c.Date(data, dttm_ct)
#> [1] "1970-01-02" "1979-11-10"
c(dttm_ct, date)  # equal to c.POSIXct(date, dttm_ct)
#> "1970-01-01 09:00:00 CST" "1970-01-01 08:00:01 CST"

# The generic function dispatches based on the class of its first argument.
# When `c.Date()` is executed , `dttm_ct` is converted to a date, but the 3600 seconds are mistaken for 3600 days!
# When `c.POSIXct()` is called on `date`, one day counts as second only, as illustraed by the following line:
unclass(c(date, dttm_ct)) # internal representation
#> [1]    1 3600
date + 3599
#> [1] "1979-11-10"

# Some of these problems may be avoided via explicit conversion of the classes:
c(as.Date(dttm_ct, tz = "UTC"), date)
#> [1] "1970-01-01" "1970-01-02"

# Let's look at `unlist()`, which operates on list input.
# attributes are stripped
unlist(list(date, dttm_ct))
#> [1]    1 3600

# We see that internally dates(-times) are stored as doubles.
# Unfortunately this is all we are left with, when unlist strips the attributes of the list.

# To summarise: `c()` coerces types and errors may occur because of inappropriate methos dispatch.
# `unlist()` strips attributes.

# 3.6 Data frames and tibbles

# The two most important S3 vectors built on top of lists are data frames and tibbles.
# If you do data analysis in R, you're going to be using data frames.
# A data frame is a named list of vectors with attributes for (column) `names`, `row.names`, and its class, "data.frame":
df1 <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y =letters[1:3])
typeof(df1)
#> [1] "list"

attributes(df1)
#> $names
#> [1] "x" "y"
#> 
#> $class
#> [1] "data.frame"
#> 
#> $row.names
#> [1] 1 2 3

# In contrast to a regular list, a data frame has an additional constraint: the length of each of its vectors must be the same.
# This gives data frames their rectangular structure and explains why they share the properties of both matrices and lists:

# - A data frame has `rownames()` and `colnames()`. The `names()` of a  data frame are the column names.

# - A data frame has `nrow()` rows and `ncol()` columns. The `length()` of a data framr gives the number of columns.

# Data frame are one of the biggest and most impotrant ideas in R, and one of the things that makes R different from other programming languages.
# However, in the over 20 years since their creation, the ways that people use r have changed, and some of the design decisions that sense at the time data frames were created now cause frustration.

# The frustration lead to the createion of the tibble (MÃ¼ller and Wickham 2018), a modern reimagining of the data frame.
# Tibbles are designed to be (as much as possible) drop-in replacements for data frames that fix those frustrations.
# A concise, and fun, way to summarise the main differences is that tibbles are lazy and surly: they do less and complain more.
# You'll see that that means as you work through this section.

# Tibbles are provied by th tibble package and share the same structure as data frames.
# The only difference is that the class vector is longer, and includes `tbl_df`.
# This allows tibbles to behave differently in the key ways which we'll discuss below.
library(tibble)

df2 <- tibble(x = 1:3, y = letters[1:3])
typeof(df2)
#> [1] list

attributes(df2)
#> $names
#> [1] "x" "y"
#> 
#> $row.names
#> [1] 1 2 3
#> 
#> $class
#> [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"

# 3.6.1 Creating

# You crate a data frame by supplying name-vector pairs to `data.frame()`:
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3,
  y = c("a", "b", "c")
)
str(df)
#> 'data.frame':    3 obs. of  2 variables:
#>  $ x: int  1 2 3
#>  $ y: Factor w/ 3 levels "a","b","c": 1 2 3

# Beware of the default conversion of strings to factors.
# Use `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` to suppress this and keep character vectors as character vectors:
df1 <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3,
  y = c("a", "b", "c"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
str(df1)
#> 'data.frame':    3 obs. of  2 variables:
#>  $ x: int  1 2 3
#>  $ y: chr  "a" "b" "c"

# Creating a tibble is similar to creating a data frame. The difference between the two is that tibbles never coerce their inpu (this is one feature that makes them lazy):
df2 <- tibble(
  x = 1:3, 
  y = c("a", "b", "c")
)
str(df2)
#> Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    3 obs. of  2 variables:
#>  $ x: int  1 2 3
#>  $ y: chr  "a" "b" "c"

# Additionally, while data frames automatically transform non-syntactic names( unless `check.names = FALSE`), 
# tibble do not (although they do print non-syntactic names surrounded by ` ` `).
names(data.frame(`1` = 1))
#> [1] "X1"
names(tibble(`1` = 1))
#> [1] "1"

# While every element of a data frame (or tibble) must have the same length, both `data.frame()` and `tibble()` will rebycle shorter inputs.
# However, while data frames automatically recycle columns that are an integer multiple of the longest column, 
# tibbles will only recyle vectors of length one.
data.frame(x = 1:4, y = 1:2)
#>   x y
#> 1 1 1
#> 2 2 2
#> 3 3 1
#> 4 4 2
data.frame(x = 1:4, y = 1:3)
#> Error in data.frame(x = 1:4, y = 1:3) : arguments imply differing number of rows: 4, 3

tibble(x = 1:4, y = 1)
#> # A tibble: 4 x 2
#>       x     y
#>   <int> <dbl>
#> 1     1     1
#> 2     2     1
#> 3     3     1
#> 4     4     1
tibble(x = 1:4, y = 1:2)
#> Error: Tibble columns must have consistent lengths, only values of length one are recycled:
#> * Length 2: Column `y`
#> * Length 4: Column `x`
#> Call `rlang::last_error()` to see a backtrace

# There is one final difference: `tibble()` allows you to refer to variables created during construction:
tibble(
  x = 1:3, 
  y = x * 2
)
#> # A tibble: 3 x 2
#>       x     y
#>   <int> <dbl>
#> 1     1     2
#> 2     2     4
#> 3     3     6
# (Inputs are evaluated left-to-right.)

# When drawing data frames and tibbles, rather than focussing on the implementation details, i.e. the attributes:

# I'll draw them the same way as a named list, but arrange them to emplasis their cloumnar structrue.

# 3.6.2 Row names

# Data frames allow you to label each row with a name, a character vector containing only unique values:
df3 <- data.frame(
  age = c(35, 27, 18),
  hair = c("blond", "brown", "black"),
  row.names = c("Bob", "Susan", "Sam")
)
df3

# You can get and set row names with `rownames()`, and you can use them to subset rows:
rownames(df3)
#> [1] "Bob"   "Susan" "Sam" 

df3["Bob", ]
#>     age  hair
#> Bob  35 blond

# Row naems arise naturally if you think of data frames as 2D structures like matrices: columns (variable) have names so rows (observations) should too.
# Most matrices are numeric, so having a place to store charaacter labels is importan.
# But this analgy to matrices is misleading becuase matrices possess an important property that data frames do not: they are transposable.
# In matrices the rows and columns are interchangeable, and transposing a matrix gives you another matrix (transposing again gives you the original matrix).
# With data frames, however, the rows and columns are not interchangeable: the transpose of a data frame is not a data frame.

# There are three reasions why row names are undesireable:

# - Metadata is data, so storing it in a different way to the rest of the data is fundamentally a bad idea.
#   It also means that you need to learn a new set of tools to work with row names; 
#   you can't use what you already know about manipulating columns.

# - Row names are a poor abstraction for labelling rows because they only work when a row can be identified by a single string.
#   This fails in many cases, for exmaple when you want to identify a row by a non-character vector (e.g. a time point),
#   or with multiple vectors (e.g. position, encoded by latitude and longtitude).

# - Row names must be unique, so any duplication of rows (e.g. from bootstrapping) will create new row names.
#   If you want to match rows from before and after the transformation, you'll need to perform complicated string surgery.
df3[c(1, 1, 1), ]
#>       age  hair
#> Bob    35 blond
#> Bob.1  35 blond
#> Bob.2  35 blond

# For these reasions, tibbles do not support row names.
# Instead the tibble package provides ot easily convert row names into a regular column with either `rownames_to_columm()`, or `rownames` argumet in `as_tibble()`:
as_tibble(df3, rownames = "name")
#> # A tibble: 3 x 3
#>   name    age hair 
#>   <chr> <dbl> <fct>
#> 1 Bob      35 blond
#> 2 Susan    27 brown
#> 3 Sam      18 black

# 3.6.3 Printing

# One of the most obvious differences between tibbles and data frames is how they print.
# I assume that you're already familiar with how data frmaes are printed, 
# so here I'll highlight some of the biggest differences using an example dataset included in the dplyr package:
dplyr::starwars
#> # A tibble: 87 x 13
#>    name  height  mass hair_color skin_color eye_color birth_year gender
#>    <chr>  <int> <dbl> <chr>      <chr>      <chr>          <dbl> <chr> 
#>  1 Lukeâ€¦    172    77 blond      fair       blue            19   male  
#>  2 C-3PO    167    75 <NA>       gold       yellow         112   <NA>  
#>  3 R2-D2     96    32 <NA>       white, blâ€¦ red             33   <NA>  
#>  4 Dartâ€¦    202   136 none       white      yellow          41.9 male  
#>  5 Leiaâ€¦    150    49 brown      light      brown           19   female
#>  6 Owenâ€¦    178   120 brown, grâ€¦ light      blue            52   male  
#>  7 Beruâ€¦    165    75 brown      light      blue            47   female
#>  8 R5-D4     97    32 <NA>       white, red red             NA   <NA>  
#>  9 Biggâ€¦    183    84 black      light      brown           24   male  
#> 10 Obi-â€¦    182    77 auburn, wâ€¦ fair       blue-gray       57   male  
#> # â€¦ with 77 more rows, and 5 more variables: homeworld <chr>,
#> #   species <chr>, films <list>, vehicles <list>, starships <list>

# - Tibbles only show the first 10 rows and the columns that will fit on screen.
#   Additional columns are shown at the bottom.

# - Each column is labelled with its type, abbreviated to three or four letters.

# - Wide columns are truncated to avoid having a single long string occupy an entire row.
#   (This is still a work in progress: it's a tricky tradeoff between showing as many coumnns as possible and showing columns in their entirely.)

# When used in console envionments that support it, colour is used judiciously to highlight important information, and de-emphasise supplemental details.

# 3.6.4 Subsetting

# As you will learn in Chapter 4, you can subset a data frame or a tibble like a 1 D structure (where it behaves like a list), or a 2 D structure(wherer it behaves like a matrix).

# In my opinion, data frames have two undesireable subsetting behaviours:

# - When you subset columns with `df[, vars]`, you will get a vector if `vars` selects on variable, otherwise you'll get a data frame.
#   This is a frequent source of bugs when useing `[` in a function, unless you always remember to use `df[, vars, drop = FALSE`

# - When you attempt to extract a single column with `df$x` and there is no column `x`, a data frame will instead select any variable that starts with `x`.
#   If no variable starts with `x`, `df$x` will return `NULL`.
#   This makes it easy to select the wrong variable or to select a variable that doesn't exist.

# Tibble tweak these behavours so that a `[` always returns tibble, and `$` doesn't do partial matching and warns if it can't find a variable(this is what makes tibbles surly).
df1 <- data.frame(xyz = "a")
df2 <- tibble(xyz = "a")

str(df1$x)
#>  Factor w/ 1 level "a": 1
str(df2$x)
#> NULL
#> Warning message: Unknown or uninitialised column: 'x'. 

# A tibble's insistence on returning a data frame from `[` can cause problems with legacy code, which often uses `df[, "col"]` to extract a single column.
# If you want a single column, I resommend using df[["col"]].
# This clearly communicates your intent, and works with both data frmaes and tibbles.

# 3.6.5 Testing and coercing

# To check if an object is a data frame or tibble, use `is.data.frame()`:
is.data.frame(df1)
#> [1] TRUE
is.data.frame(df2)
#> [1] TRUE

# Typically, it should not matter if you have a tibble or data frame, but if you need to be certain, use `is_tibble()`:
is_tibble(df1)
#> [1] FALSE
is_tibble(df2)
#> [1] TRUE

# You can coerce an object to a data frame with `as.data.frame()` or to a tibble with `as_tibble()`.

# 3.6.6 List columns

# Since a data frame is a list of vectors, it is possibble of ra data frame to have a column that is a list.
# This is very useful becuase a list can contain any other object: this means you can put any object in a data frame.
# This allows you to keep related ojects together in a row, no matter how complex the individual object are.
# You can see an application of this in the Many Models" chapter of R for Data Science, http://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html.

# List-columns are allowed in data frames but you have to do a little extra work by either adding the list-column after creation or wrapping the list in `I()`.
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3)
df$y <- list(1:2, 1:3, 1:4)

data.frame(
  x = 1:3,
  y = I(list(1:2, 1:3, 1:4))
) 

# List columns are easier to use with tibbles becuase they can be directly included inside `tibble()` and they will be printed tidily:
tibble(
  x = 1:3,
  y = list(1:2, 1:3, 1:4)
)

# 3.6.7 Matrix and data frame columns

# As long as the number of rows matches the data frame, it's also possible to have a matrix or array as a column of a data frame.
# (This require a slight extension to our definition of a data frame: it's not the `length()` of each column that must be equal, but the `NROW()`.)
# As for list-columns, you must wither add it after creation, or wrap it in `I()`.
dfm <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3 * 10
)
dfm$y <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
dfm$z <- data.frame(a = 3:1, b = letters[1:3], stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
str(dfm)
#> 'data.frame':    3 obs. of  3 variables:
#>  $ x: num  10 20 30
#>  $ y: int [1:3, 1:3] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
#>  $ z:'data.frame':   3 obs. of  2 variables:
#>   ..$ a: int  3 2 1
#>   ..$ b: chr  "a" "b" "c"

# Matrix and data frame columns require a little caution.
# Many functions that work with data frames assume that all columns are vectors.
# Also, the printed display can be confusing.
dfm[1, ]
#>    x y.1 y.2 y.3 z.a z.b
#> 1 10   1   4   7   3   a

# 3.6.8 Exercises

# 1. Can you have a data frame with zero rows? What abotu zero columns?

# Yes, you can create these data frames easily adn in many ways.
# Even both dimensions can be 0.
# e.g. you might subset the respective diension with either `0`, `NULL` or a valid 0-length atomic(`loghcal(0)`, `character(0)`, `integer(0)`, `double(0)`).
# Negative integer sequences would also work.
# The following example uses a zero:
iris[0, ]
#> [1] Sepal.Length Sepal.Width  Petal.Length Petal.Width  Species     
#> <0 rows> (or 0-length row.names)

iris[, 0]
#> ata frame with 0 columns and 150 rows

iris[0, 0]
#> data frame with 0 columns and 0 rows

# Empty data frames can also be create directly (without subsetting):
data.frame()
#> data frame with 0 columns and 0 rows

# 2. What happens if you attempt to set rwonames that are not unique?

# Matrices can have dulplicated row names, so this does now cuase problems

# Data frames, however, required unique rownames and you get different results depending on how you attrmpt to set them.
# If you use `row.names()` directly, you get an error:
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3)
row.names(df) <- c("x", "y", "y")
# Error in `.rowNamesDF<-`(x, value = value) : duplicate 'row.names' are not allowed
# In addition: Warning message: non-unique value when setting 'row.names': â€˜yâ€™ 

# If you use subsetting, `[` automatically deduplicates:
row.names(df) <- c("x", "y", "z")
df[c(1, 1, 1), , drop = FALSE]
#>     x
#> x   1
#> x.1 1
#> x.2 1

# 3. I `df` is a data frame, what can you say about `t(df)`, and `t(t(df))`?
#    Perform some experiments, making sure to try different column types.

# Both will return matrices:
df <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = 5:1)
is.matrix(df)
#> [1] FALSE
is.matrix(t(df))
#> [1] TRUE
is.matrix(t(t(df)))
#> [1] TRUE

# Whose dimensions respect the typical tarnsposition rules:
dim(df)
#> [1] 5 2
dim(t(df))
#> [1] 2 5
dim(t(t(df)))
#> [1] 5 2

# Because the output is a matrix, every column is coerced to the same type by `as.matrix()`, as described below.

# 4. What does `as.matrix()` do when applied to a data frame with columns of different types?
#    How does it differ from `data.matrix()`?

# From `?as.matrix`:
# The method for data frames will return a character matrix if there is only atomic columns and any non-(numeric/logical/complex) column, 
# applying as.vector to factors and format to other non-character columns. 
# Otherwise the usual coercion hierarchy (logical < integer < double < complex) will be used, e.g., 
# all-logical data frames will be coerced to a logical matrix, mixed logical-integer will give a integer matrix, etc.

# Let's tranform a dummy data frame into a character matrix.
# Note that `format()` is applied to the characters, which gives surprising results: `TRUE` is transformed to `"TRUE"` (starting with space!).
df_coltypes <- data.frame(
  a = c("a", "b"),
  b = c(TRUE, FALSE),
  c = c(1L, 0L),
  d = c(1.5, 2),
  e = c("one" = 1, "two" = 2),
  g = factor(c("f1", "f2")),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
as.matrix(df_coltypes)
#>     a   b       c   d     e   g   
#> one "a" "TRUE"  "1" "1.5" "1" "f1"
#> two "b" "FALSE" "0" "2.0" "2" "f2"

# From `?as.data.matrix`:
# Return the matrix obtained by converting all the variables in a data frame to numeric mode and then binding them together as the columns of a matrix. 
# Factors and ordered factors are replaced by their internal codes.

# `data.matrix()` returns a numeric matrix, where characters are replace by missing values:
data.matrix(df_coltypes)
#>      a b c   d e g
#> one NA 1 1 1.5 1 1
#> two NA 0 0 2.0 2 2
#> Warning in data.matrix(df_coltypes): NAs introduced by coercion

# 3.7 NULL

# To finish up this chapter, I want to talk about one final important data structure that's closely related to vectors: `NULL`.
# `NULL` is special because it has a unique type, is alwarys length zero, and can't have any attributes:
typeof(NULL)
#> [1] "NULL"

length(NULL)
#> [1] 0

x <- NULL
attr(x, "y") <- 1
#> Error in attr(x, "y") <- 1 : attempt to set an attribute on NULL

# You can test for `NULL`s with `is.null()`:
is.null(NULL)
#> [1] TRUE

# There are two common uses of `NULL`:

# - To represent an empty vector (a vector of length zero) of arbitrary type.
#   For example, if you use `c()` but don't include any arguments, you get `NULL`, and cocatennating `NULL` to a vector will leave it unchanged:
c()
#> NULL

# - To represent an absent vector. For exmaple, `NULL` is often used as a default function argument, when the argument is optinal but the default value requires some computation (see section 6.5.3 for more on this).
#   Contrast this with `NA` which is used to indicate that an element of a vector is absent.

# If you're familiar with SQL, you'll know about relational `NULL` and might expect it to be the same as R's.
# However, the database `NULL` is actually equivalent to R's `NA`.

# 3.8 Quiz answers

# 1. The four common types of atomic vector are logical, integer, double and character.
#    The two rarer types are complex and raw.

# 2. Attributes allow you to associate arbitrary additional metadata to any object.
#    You can get and set individual attributes with `attr(x, "y")` and `attr(x, "y") <- value`;
#    or you cna get and set all attributes at once with `attributes()`.

# 3. The elements of a list can be any type (even a list); the elements of an atomic vector are all of the same type.
#    Similarly, every element of a matrix must be the same type;
#    in a data frame, different columns can have different types.

# 4. You can make a list-array by assigning dimensios to a list.
#    You cam make a matrix a bolumn of a data frame with `df$x <- matrix()`, or by using `I()` when creating a new data frame `data.frame(x = I(matrix()))`.

# 5. Tibbles have an enhanced print method, never coerce strings to factors, and provide stricter subsetting methods.
