# 26 Introduction

# So far, you've learned the tools to get your data into R, tidy it into a from convenient for analysis, 
# and then understand your data through transfromation, visualisation and modelling.
# Howevery, it doesn't matter how great your analysis is unless you can explain it ot others: you need to comunicate your results.

#  Program

# Communication is the theme of the following four chapters:
# 1. In R Markdown, you will learn about R Markdown, a tool for integrating prose, code, and results.
#    You can use R Markdown in notebook mode for analyst-to-analyst communicatio, and in report mode for analyst-to-decision-maker communication.
#    Thanks to the power of R Markdown formats, you can even use the same document for both purposes.
# 2. In graphics for communication, you will learn how to take your exploratory graphics and turn them into expositor graphics,
#    graphics that help the newcomer to your analysis understand what's going on as quickly and easily as possibel.
# 3. In R Markdown formats, you'll learn a little about the many other vauieties of outputs you can produce using R Markdown, 
#    inluding dashboards, websites, and books.
# 4. We'll finish up with R Markdown workflow, where you'll learn about the "analysis notebook" 
#    and how to systematically recoud your successes and failures so that you can learn from them.

# Unfortunately, these chapters focus mostly on the technical mechanics of communication, 
# not the really hard problems of communicating your thoughts to other humans.
# However, there are lot of other great books about communication, which we'll point you to at the end of each chapter.
