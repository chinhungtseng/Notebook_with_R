# 9 Introduction
# This part of the book proceeds as follows:

## 1. In tibbles, you’ll learn about the variant of the data frame that we use in this book: the tibble. 
##    You’ll learn what makes them different from regular data frames, and how you can construct them “by hand”.

## 2. In data import, you’ll learn how to get your data from disk and into R. We’ll focus on plain-text rectangular formats, 
##    but will give you pointers to packages that help with other types of data.

## 3. In tidy data, you’ll learn about tidy data, a consistent way of storing your data that makes transformation, 
##    visualisation, and modelling easier. You’ll learn the underlying principles, and how to get your data into a tidy form.
