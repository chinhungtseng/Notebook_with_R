# 9 Introduction

# This part of the book proceeds as follows:
## 1. In tibbles, you’ll learn about the variant of the data frame that we use in this book: the tibble. 
##    You’ll learn what makes them different from regular data frames, and how you can construct them “by hand”.

## 2. In data import, you’ll learn how to get your data from disk and into R. We’ll focus on plain-text rectangular formats, 
##    but will give you pointers to packages that help with other types of data.

## 3. In tidy data, you’ll learn about tidy data, a consistent way of storing your data that makes transformation, 
##    visualisation, and modelling easier. You’ll learn the underlying principles, and how to get your data into a tidy form.

# Data wrangling also encompasses data transformation. 
# Now we’ll focus on new skills for three specific types of data you will frequently encounter in practice:
## 1. Relational data will give you tools for working with multiple interrelated datasets.
## 2. Strings will introduce regular expressions, a powerful tool for manipulating strings.
## 3. Factors are how R stores categorical data. 
## 4. Dates and times will give you the key tools for working with dates and date-times.
